# GitHub Pages Main.ts Fix Summary

## Issue
The GitHub Pages deployment was failing because `main.ts` and other assets were not found. The built `index.html` was referencing incorrect paths.

## Root Cause
1. Missing `public` directory with required assets (vite.svg)
2. Vite configuration needed explicit `publicDir` setting
3. Build process was not generating correct asset paths

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Missing Public Directory
```bash
mkdir public
```

### 2. Added Required Assets
- Created `public/vite.svg` with the Vite logo
- This file gets copied to `dist/` during build

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ... existing config
  publicDir: 'public'  // ← Added this line
})
```

### 4. Fixed Build Process
- The build now correctly generates paths with `/monitoring-dashboard/` prefix
- All assets are properly copied to `dist/` directory

## Verification
✅ Built `dist/index.html` now has correct paths:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/monitoring-dashboard/vite.svg" />
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/monitoring-dashboard/assets/index-*.js"></script>
```

✅ Local preview works at: `http://localhost:3000/monitoring-dashboard/`

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to trigger GitHub Actions deployment
2. Verify deployment works on GitHub Pages
3. Check that all assets load correctly on the live site

## Commands to Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages asset paths and missing public directory"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the updated build.
